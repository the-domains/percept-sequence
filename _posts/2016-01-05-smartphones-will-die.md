Smartphones will die. It's just a matter of time. 

With the introduction of both virtual and augmented reality, handsets will start to disappear. As is the primary topic of the book 'Vaporized' (Robert Tercek), physical things have a tendency to lose their form and become digitised.  One often cited example is the failure of Kodak to adopt to a world where the future of photography was digital. There's something sentimental about being about to touch something real - Kodak thought that, among other things, the 'grainy' appearance of film gave it character that would triumph over all - but sentimentality gave way to convenience.

If you look at Magic Leap's patents, they indicate that this vaporization of physical into digital will occur. Their patents indicate the juxtaposition of virtual images onto our hand. This is obviously more convenient than holding a physical phone - the weight of the phone will dissipate to nil. (_[This article ][0]by Wired gives a brief overview of a few of the patents the [actual patents themselves][1] are detailed, complex, broad, and not really designed for laypeople to be read. Nonetheless, they are incredibly interesting._) It's not exactly the same, but one cannot help but think there may be parallels between the disappearance of physical photos into the digital world, and the disappearance of physical objects into the virtual realm. 

Another example of this trend is, of course, e-books. The reason that we still enjoy the smell of paper and the feel of the pages turning is, well, we were brought up with it and it also has sentimental value. Can we still say that for younger generations who consume information through laptops and iPads and - eventually - virtual and augmented reality?

The abolition of smartphones will likely be a slow process. Huge numbers of those in third-world countries will not have a laptop as their first device, but a smartphone instead. Therefore, it is likely that smartphones will continue to exist for a few decades at the very least, simply because of this discrepancy in technological advancement between countries of poverty and countries of wealth. There's thus no need for those currently earning a living from mobile stores to panic yet, either.

However, in all technological progressions, utility will forever triumph over sentimentality...eventually.
