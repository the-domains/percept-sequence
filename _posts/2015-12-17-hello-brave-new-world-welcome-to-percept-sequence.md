# Hello, Brave New World: Welcome To 'Percept Sequence' 

In artificial intelligence (AI), a **percept** is an input that an intelligent agent receives at a given moment. The **percept sequence **is the complete history of every and any percept that has been received. Importantly, a _rational agent's choice of action can only depend on its percept sequence_ and - conversely - not on anything it hasn't perceived. 

The concept of artificial intelligence has been around for a long time. The field of AI research is said to be founded in 1956\. From that point onwards, it experienced tremendous highs when achievements deemed impossible by academics were reached. It also had its lows, such as when optimism for the capabilities of AI far exceeded reality. 

Nowadays, however, AI is the "cool" concept of the era. It takes only a brief glance at today's tech startups to see that both investors and consumers alike love the idea of AI; just look for the words "artificial intelligence" in the front pages of Product Hunt. Even the website that this blog is made with, [thegrid.io][0], promises to make AI websites that design themselves and has more than 64,000 paying members despite not having even come out of beta (at the time of writing). 

**Artificial intelligence** is simultaneously captivating _and_ extremely important for the future of humanity. **Augmented reality (AR) - **juxtaposing virtual objects onto a perception of the real world to create the illusion of physical objects - also fits these two criteria. **Startups **are the most important way that these two ideas will be executed. Lastly, **healthcare **will see radical transformation and the very concept of doctors will be shaken at its core by the interaction of these elements. 

These topics are what this blog, **Percept Sequence,** is about.
